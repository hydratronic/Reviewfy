<!--
This is a HTML file that serves as the main layout for the web application.
The file includes meta tags, links to external CSS and JS libraries, and the body of the page.
The title of the page is set dynamically with the "title" variable that is passed in.

The file uses Bootstrap 5, a popular CSS framework, to style the page.
There is also a custom CSS file that is included with the "style" variable.
The "header" and "footer" are included with the "include" function, which pulls in other HTML files.
The "body" variable is where the content of the web pages is inserted.

There are several script tags included to load various JS libraries, including Bootstrap and Popper.js.
The "script" variable is where additional JS code can be inserted for specific pages.
